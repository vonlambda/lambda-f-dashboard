# Methodology Overview

Lambda-F uses the matrix commutator [F, Ḟ] to measure non-commutativity 
of factor covariance dynamics. Combined with a correlation synchronization 
signal, the two-signal system achieves 100% detection on institutional events.

## Key Concepts
- Factor covariance matrix evolution
- Commutator-based rotation detection  
- Correlation-based synchronization detection
- Percentile-based regime classification

## Parameters
Optimized parameters are documented in the provisional patent application.
Full methodology available to research partners under NDA.

## Validation
See events.csv for the complete audit trail of 22 events tested.
