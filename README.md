### Regime Classification

| Regime | Percentile | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | >= 90% | Major factor rotation in progress |
| **ELEVATED** | 75-89% | Above-normal stress |
| Normal | < 75% | Baseline conditions |

## What Is This?

Lambda-F measures the **curvature** of the market's path through factor space—not just volatility (speed) or returns (direction).

When institutional investors rotate between factors simultaneously, the factor covariance matrix "twists." This non-commutativity is detectable before the price impact fully materializes.
